        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this recipe, you will learn how to make my classic scrambled eggs. I'm somebody who used to hate scrambled eggs. If they weren't on a sandwich, I typically wasn't a fan.</p>
        <p>These eggs, however, are different than the ones I was used to. These eggs are fluffy, tasty, a great source of protein, and making them has become a staple part of my morning routine. Are you ready? Let's begin!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (or more) large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk (1 tablespoon per large egg)</li>
            <li>3 dashes salt</li>
            <li>2 dashes pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese(mozzarella or mexican style four cheese blend)</li>
